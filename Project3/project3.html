        <h2>Explain the importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience.</h2>
        <p>Responsive design is a massive part of what makes a website stand out as <b>Better</b>. Websites are now more viewed on smaller screens like tablets and phones which means responsive design and ability to be viewed on all screens is highly important. In fact, desktop view of websites will likely be the view that are least cared for in the future as mobile view is dominating traffic. One way people judge companies and products is on how good their website works and functions. Properly working responsive design will not only look better between devices but also might just win over a few customers.</p>

        <h2>Google Analytics provides a wealth of data for free to help assess the success of websites. Describe three different kinds of reports that will tell you what information your target audience is accessing</h2>
        <p>Google Analytics is a powerful tool for businesses to use. It can show you what areas are of concern on your website, areas that are rarely clicked on, the most important pages on your website, and even set goals to reach a certain amount of clicks, likes, or downloads. Three of the most important reports that can be found on Google Analytics are the Mobile Overview Report, Site Speed Overview Report, and the Goal Overview Report. The Mobile Overview report gives you a wide range of information about your mobile site and will give you points of strength and weakness based on user interactions. The site Speed Overview will give you a report on what pages are loading slowly for users and can even partially give answers as to why this could be happening. Another use for this report is to see how fast your pages are loading around the world. The last and arguably most important report is the Goal Overview Report. Say you have been struggling with click on one page on your website and you have made adjustments to make viewers more apt to click on the page. This report allows you to set goals and track the min real time to see how your changes are working and see if you are reaching your goals.</p>
