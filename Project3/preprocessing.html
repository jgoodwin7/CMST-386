<!--How I implemented my LESS: I am currently running windows and used VSC or Visual Coding Studio with an extention to preprocess my less file into a css file. Both are linked in this document. I used variables to change the color of the article on this page.-->

        <h2>Explain the ways to implement preprocessing (client-side vs server-side)</h2>
        <p>There are two main way to implement these forms of preprocessing: client-side or server-side. These both do the same thing but the difference is where they occur. Client-side preproccessing is done on the machine running the LESS or SASS and is implemented right into the code for the webpage. Server-side preprocessing is done through a server and can be used in web-developement with just a quick stylesheet link. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Define and describes the mechanisms used in either LESS or SASS: mixins, variables, functions, operators, nested variables</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of things that can be done in LESS. Some of these mechanisms inlcude variables, mixins, operators, and nested variables. Variables are used to define a specific parameter to be used across all lines of LESS. These are typically defined with the @ symbol and are called on using the format "color: @variable;". Mixins are one of my favorite features of LESS. This allows you to combine selectors together that share the same css attributes. Functions are a little more complicated and follow similar structure to JavaScript funtions. This is essentially a conditional statments that will return a value based on which condition is met. Nested variables are variables that can be nested under eachother. This works great when you are trying to edit an entire selector and can easily implement variables into this.</p>
